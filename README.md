## üóùÔ∏è Key Features 
- Asynchronous API GET, POST, PUT, DELETE operations
- File upload
- Search, sort and pagination
- Dark mode switching
- Responsive and accessible design

## ü§ì What I learned
- **Request API calls asynchronously** and perform **`CRUD`** operations.
- **File inputs** are considered **`uncontrolled components`** for security reasons.
- **Form components can be reused** for creating a new post or editing an existing post. Passing **different props** with **initial values** enables this functionality.
- Use **`Context`** to prevent prop drilling and apply **global state** such as dark mode.
- **`Pagination with a cursor`** for handling large datasets
- **`Responsive` design**: mobile-friendly.
- **`Accessibility` design**: includes button hover color contrast, using **`alt`** attributes for images, and supporting **`Enter`** key submission.
